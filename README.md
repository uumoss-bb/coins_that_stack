## Testing

- npm run test

## CLI Display

- place json bank data in './transactions'
- link transactions in cli files
- npm run displayTotal
- npm run displayStacks

## TODO:

- I need to build an auditing system
  - Refresh your transactions to be up to date (manually)
  - Filter transactions from the last update (done)
  - Update the Stacks with this restricted data
  - Display old and new data, get confirmation
  - Subtract the new data minus the old data

- ** I need a system for displaying and dumping extra cash

- It would also by cool to have an auditing system that ran
though all your transactions and start from zero. Not sure what value that would bring but it would be cool.
